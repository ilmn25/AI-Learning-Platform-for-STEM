# STEM Learning Platform (Web)

This is the Next.js application for the STEM Learning Platform.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm

## Setup

1. Copy `web/.env.example` to `web/.env.local` and fill in keys.
2. From the repo root, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Core Features (WIP)

- Auth with Supabase
- Class creation and join code enrollment
- Materials upload with PDF/DOCX/PPTX extraction
- Course blueprint generation (AI powered)
- AI powered learning activities

## Notes

- Database migrations live in `supabase/` at the repo root.
- Run Supabase migrations before testing class creation.
- New accounts must choose an immutable account type at signup (`teacher` or `student`).
- Enable Supabase Auth email confirmation so users must verify email before protected access.
- Disable Supabase phone auth provider (phone-based auth is intentionally out of scope).
- Ensure the `materials` storage bucket exists for uploads.
- Configure at least one AI provider with both a chat model and an embedding model.
- Default background ingestion backend is `MATERIAL_WORKER_BACKEND=supabase`, which enqueues jobs through Supabase `pgmq`.
- Supabase Cron dispatches the `material-worker` Edge Function (configured by migration and Vault secrets).
- `POST /api/materials/process` is a legacy fallback worker path when `MATERIAL_WORKER_BACKEND=legacy`.
- For full staging + production rollout steps, see `../DEPLOYMENT.md`.
